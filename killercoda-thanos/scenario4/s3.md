# Verify Setup
At this point, we have:

Two Prometheus instances configured to remote_write and running in agent mode.
Thanos Receive component ingesting data from Prometheus
Thanos Query component configured to query Thanos Receive 's Store API.
The final task on our list is to verify that data is flowing correctly.

Stop and think how you could do this before opening the answer below ðŸ‘‡
Let's make sure that we can query data from each of our Prometheus instances from our Thanos Query instance.
Navigate to the Thanos Query UI, and query for a metric like up or go_goroutines - inspect the output and you should see batmobile and batcopter in the cluster label.
go_goroutines should look something like on image below:

# Summary
Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

Batmobile is now well-monitored! Batman says thank you!

You completed this Prometheus Agent tutorial. Let's summarize what we learned:

Thanos Receive is a component that implements the Prometheus Remote Write protocol.
Prometheus Agent can be deployed to remote write its metric data in real-time to another server that implements the Remote Write protocol.
Prometheus Agent uses a fraction of the resources as normal Prometheus, by not enabling features like: local metrics storage and local query APIs.
