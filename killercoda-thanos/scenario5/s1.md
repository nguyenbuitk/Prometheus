Advanced: Querying with low tail-latency and low cost - Query caching with Thanos
Welcome to the tutorial where you learn how to introduce query caching using Query Frontend with Thanos.

In this tutorial you will learn:

Setup a simple observability stack using Prometheus
Deploy and configure Thanos Query Frontend in front of your Queriers so that we can cache query responses
We aim to achieve:

Low cost query execution
Low latency query execution
Si reduce cost of infrastructure
